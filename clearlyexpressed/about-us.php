				<div id="titel" class="uberuns"></div>
				<p class="zitat">„Say what we may of the inadequacy of translation, yet the work is and will always be one of the weightiest and worthiest undertakings in the general concerns of the world.“
                <br>J. W. Goethe</p>

                <h3>Annette Frischmann</h3>
				<h2>The Art of an Excellent Translation<span class="red"></span></h2>
				<p>Building a bridge between the source language and the target language is the art of creating an excellent translation.  It is the task of every translator to understand and capture the subtleties of the source language so that he or she is able to master the technical and/or cultural transfer into the respective target language.</p>
				<p>After graduating from High School in Germany, Annette became a certified Executive Assistant in 1999.  After working in the leisure and tourism industry as Executive Assistant in Germany for 2 years, she went back to University and took courses in Applied Linguistics and Cultural Studies.  Annette graduated from the Johannes Gutenberg-University in Mainz, Germany, holding a translation degree in English, German and French with a major in Economics in 2008.  From 2008 until 2009, Annette was working for Grant Thornton LLP in Vancouver, Canada and from 2010 until 2012 for Swiss Paraplegic Research in Switzerland.  Annette has been offering translation services for English, German, French and Italian together with her colleague Denise in Germany since her return to Vancouver in 2012.  Annette is an associate member of the Society of Translators and Interpreters in British Columbia as well as the respective association of Germany (Bundesverand der Dolmetscher und Übersetzer (BDÜ)).</p>
<p>Several extended stays in Vancouver, Canada, enabled Annette to gain a thorough knowledge of the cultural characteristics of the English language as well as work experience in the corporate world of Western Canada.</p>

                <h3>Denise Lachmann</h3>
                <h2>High Performances for Optimal Interpretations<span class="red"></span></h2>
				<p>After graduating from High School in Germany in 2003, Denise enrolled at the Johannes Gutenberg-University in Mainz, Germany, and took her translation degree in 2008 in English, German and French with a major in Economics.  After a six-months’ internship at a renowned translation services company in Stuttgart, Germany, she continued her studies at the Ruprecht-Karls-University in Heidelberg, Germany, and obtained her Master’s degree in conference interpreting in 2011 (languages: English, German and French).</p>
				<p>Through her extended stays in London and Cambridge, Denise gained a thorough knowledge of the English language and culture in everyday and work settings.</p>

                <h3>Annette Frischmann &amp; Denise Lachmann<span class="red"></span></h3>
